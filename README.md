# good-smash

Projects containing a single BO used for multiple front end :
- Smash 
- Papicolo
- PÃ©pites

Maybe some day this BO will be split into microservices but not sure the free heroku can manage that.

Architecture:
The project has the following modules :
- smash-app (contains config, controllers, mappers and utils)
- smash-service
- smash-persist (contains dao and entities)
- smash-spec (contains openapi specs)

Install notes : 
The generated spec might not be accessible in other modules of the project. To fix this, on IntelliJ, you can open project settings -> modules -> goodsmash-app -> dependencies -> add module dependency goodsmash-spec. If you have an error while saving because content root is already defined in other module project settings -> modules -> goodsmash -> sources -> remove paths in the content root tab not belonging to other modules.
